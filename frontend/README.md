# Weather Forecasting Application 🌤️

This project presents a weather forecasting application built using the MERN stack—specifically React, Node.js, and Express.js. The application retrieves real-time weather data, such as temperature, humidity, and other atmospheric conditions, by integrating with the OpenWeatherMap API. It serves as an educational exercise in building interactive applications using modern web technologies.

## Features

- 🌍 Fetch real-time weather data for any location
- 🌡️ Display detailed weather information including temperature, humidity, and atmospheric conditions
- ✨ Interactive UI built with React and styled using Tailwind CSS
- 🚀 Backend API built with Node.js and Express.js
- 📡 Seamless API integration for real-time data handling

## Tech Stack

**Frontend:**

- React
- Tailwind CSS
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

**Backend:**

- Node.js
- Express.js
- Axios (for making API requests)
- CORS (for enabling cross-origin requests)
- OpenWeatherMap API (for weather data)

## Libraries Used

### Frontend

- `axios`: For making HTTP requests to the weather API.
- `react-bootstrap`: For styling and layout.
- `react-router-dom`: For navigation within the app.

### Backend

- `express`: To set up the server and handle requests.
- `dotenv`: For environment variable management (e.g., API keys).
- `axios`: For making API requests from the server.
